<h2>论文摘要</h2>
This paper investigates the joint relative localization  and formation control problem of leader-follower  multi-agent systems in GPS-denied environments. Existing  results normally require persistently excited inter-agent relative  motion to achieve accurate relative localization, which  causes inevitable formation errors. To address this issue,  an adaptive distributed relative localization scheme without  persistent excitation (PE) motions, is integrated into  the leader-follower formation framework, using inter-agent  distance and onboard velocity measurements. Specifically,  by employing the parameter-estimation-based observer (PEBO) technique and introducing the dynamic extension  operation, the time-varying relative position estimation is  reformulated as an online constant parameter identification  problem. Furthermore, we develop a relative localization  based formation control strategy for stationary target  formations, and further extend it to scenarios involving  dynamic target formations. It is proved that the proposed  method guarantees the asymptotical convergence to the  desired formations. Finally, both numerical simulations and  physical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness  of our theoretical results.
